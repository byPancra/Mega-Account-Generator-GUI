## 📋 Overview

**Mega Account Generator GUI** is a robust, desktop-grade application designed for power users who need to generate and manage [MEGA.nz](https://mega.nz) accounts in bulk. Unlike simple scripts, this tool provides a complete ecosystem for account lifecycle management, including tagging, filtering, status tracking, and data export.

Built with **Modern Python** (CustomTkinter) and **Thread-Safe Architecture**, it ensures reliability even when processing hundreds of accounts.

## :zap: Features

### 🚀 Core Generation
*   **High-Speed Multi-Threading**: Generate up to 8 accounts simultaneously.
*   **Smart Rate Limiting**: Intelligent delays and retry logic (up to 12 attempts) to bypass Mail.tm restrictions.
*   **Bundled Dependencies**: The executable version comes with `megatools` pre-packaged—no external setup required.

### 🛠️ Advanced Management
*   **Tagging System**: Organize accounts with custom tags (e.g., `Personal`, `Backup`, `Client-A`) for easy retrieval.
*   **Search & Filter**: Instantly find accounts by Email, Status (`Active`, `Disabled`, `Failed`), or Tags.
*   **Bulk Operations**:
    *   **Keep-Alive**: Automated sign-in to prevent account deletion due to inactivity.
    *   **Storage Check**: Auto-update used/free storage quotas for all accounts.
    *   **Account Control**: Disable specific accounts to exclude them from bulk operations (e.g., Keep-Alive checks) without deleting them.

### 💾 Data Freedom
*   **Professional Export**: Export your database to **Excel (.xlsx)** with formatted styling or **JSON** for programmatic use.
*   **Seamless Import**: Migrate data from other tools or backups via JSON/Excel import.
*   **Clipboard Integration**: One-click copy for emails and passwords.

### 🔒 Security & Reliability
*   **Thread-Safe CSV**: Prevents data corruption during concurrent writes.
*   **Crash Recovery**: "Stop" button gracefully halts operations, preserving data integrity.

## :grey_question: FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why am I limited to 8 threads?</strong></summary>
The temporary email provider (Mail.tm) has strict rate limits. Exceeding 8 concurrent threads significantly increases the chance of IP bans or failed generations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What does the "Sign In" button do?</strong></summary>
It performs a "Keep-Alive" check. It attempts to log in to your accounts using `megatools`. This updates the storage quota information and signals to MEGA that the account is active, preventing deletion.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are my accounts saved?</strong></summary>
All data is stored locally in `accounts.csv` in the application directory. You can also export this data using the Export feature.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I see "Megatools not found" error.</strong></summary>
If running from source, ensure `megatools` is installed and added to your System PATH. If using the executable, this is handled automatically.
</details>
